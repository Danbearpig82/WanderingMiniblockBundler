Adds bundles (with loot!) to the Wandering Trader's offers for Minecraft 1.18. This is an edited version of the Wandering Bundler datapack developed for A13XFPS and Weastside Boss for their YouTube series Tides of Treasure, which you can watch here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzZMhLdD2lsPoNCHYTDSYt-lnSIQj0zj

The bundles are filled at random from with all of the miniblocks offered by the Vanilla Tweaks miniblocks datapack. The difference between this and Vanilla Tweaks' datapack is that these are randomized in a bundle instead of sold individually. It is not recommended that you use this and the Vanilla Tweaks pack in the same world.

CONFIGURING THIS PACK:

By default, the Wandering Trader will always have a bundle in his trade offers. However, if you would like him to offer the bundle less often, you can configure this to any percentage you'd like. Do this with the command "/scoreboard players set bundler.chance bundler.chance xx" (place the percentage likelihood you would like in place of the "xx"). For example, to have the Wandering Trader offer a bundle 50% of the time, run the command "/scoreboard players set bundler.chance bundler.chance 50". Or, for two out of three Wandering Traders to offer a bundle, run "/scoreboard players set bundler.chance bundler.chance 66". In a future release I intend to learn how to have these commands run from a book.
